# Real-Estate-Analysis

The analysis shows a strong correlation between the geographical location and the price of the house / the owner's income.
Obviously, as the owner's income level goes up, the house price goes up and most importantly, we found out that houses that are located close to the ocean/bay tend to be more expensive compared to 
those that are not.
